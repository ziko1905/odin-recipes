    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carne asada is a Mexican dish featuring steak that's marinated in a lime juice and seasonings mixture. It literally translates to "grilled meat," so the steak is traditionally grilled.</p>
    <p>Making this carne asada marinade is so easy: Just combine all the ingredients in a bowl. Reserve 1 cup of the marinade for use after the steak is cooked. Then place the pounded out steak in the marinade and let it sit for 24 hours.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup orange juice</li>

        <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>

        <li>⅓ cup lime juice</li>

        <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped</li>

        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice for marinade in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add cilantro, soy sauce, garlic, chili powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, chipotle pepper, and oregano; stir to combine.</li>

        <li>Slowly whisk in olive oil until well combined. Remove 1 cup of the marinade and place in a small bowl; cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for use after the steak is cooked.</li>

        <li>Place steak between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound steak with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/4 inch.</li>

        <li>After pounding, poke steak all over with a fork. Place steak in the marinade in the large bowl, cover, and marinate in the refrigerator for 24 hours.</li>

        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
    </ol>

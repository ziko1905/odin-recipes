    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This grilled baby back rib recipe calls for a savory homemade spice rub made with cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. </p>
    <p>It should take about an hour to perfectly cook these baby back ribs on the grill. Youâ€™ll know the ribs are done when an instant read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>

        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

        <li>Preheat a gas grill for high heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes on one side of the barbeque. Lightly oil the grate.</li>

        <li>Combine cumin, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small jar; close the lid and shake to mix.</li>

        <li>Trim the membrane sheath from the back of each rack. Run a small, sharp knife between the membrane and each rib, and snip off the membrane as much as possible.</li>
    </ol>
